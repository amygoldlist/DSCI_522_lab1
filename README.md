Project Setup: Directory Structure

|[setup tool](project_setup.sh)| shell script for setting up file structure|

To run the setup tool, navigate the UNIX shell to your local git repository.  You can run the script from anywhere on your computer, but for ease of typing, I like to put it into the same folder.  To run:

`bash project_setup.sh "meaningful title"`

This will create a file structure with the following folders:


* data
* doc
* src
* results
* bin

And the following two files
 * LICENSE.md
 * README.md
